VARIATIONS OF A FILLED SUDOKU

Randomize the numbers/tokens.
When I turn the letters a-i back to into the numbers 1-9 the lookup table is randomized. Meaning that a isn't always 1.
That alone creates about 300,000 variations on each puzzle.

Rotate the puzzle by 90, 180 or 270 degrees.
That adds 4 more variations.

Flop the puzzle horizontally, vertically, or both.
That adds 4 more variations.
