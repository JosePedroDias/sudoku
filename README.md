## Dev

    brew install mkcert
    mkcert -install
    mkcert localhost
    npm i -g --only=prod https-localhost

    npx https-localhost (prefix with sudo if in linux)
    visit: https://localhost/

## TODO

- validate undos are being well captured
- resolution independent
- register whether hints were asked and check too
- high score?
